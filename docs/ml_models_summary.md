# ML Models Summary

## 1. Attendance Prediction (Time Series)
- Model: Prophet / ARIMA
- Features: date, seasonality
- Metric: RMSE = 

## 2. Feedback Classifier (Sentiment Analysis)
- Model: Logistic Regression / BERT
- Features: TF-IDF, embeddings
- Metric: Accuracy = , F1 = 

## 3. Member Segmentation
- Model: KMeans clustering
- Features: frequency, class type, subscription duration
- Metric: Silhouette score = 

---
### Next Steps
- Improve attendance forecast with external factors (weather, holidays).
- Enhance feedback classifier with larger training set.
- Test hierarchical clustering for segmentation.
